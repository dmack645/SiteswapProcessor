'sr'     : shift right and print
'sl'     : shift left and print
'states' : print all states
'state'  : select index of state to print
'swap'   : performs a basic swap on two indicated values (see below)


SITESWAP INPUT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vanilla siteswap and simplified synchronous siteswap support.
If a term does not contain a null beat, an implicit null
beat (-,-) is appended to it. 
Examples:
"423" -> (-,4)(2,-)(-,3)(4,-)(-,2)(3,-)
"(6x,4)(4,6x)" -> (6x,4)(-,-)(4,6x)(-,-)

The "!" suffix on an input term prevents the appending of implicit null beat
The "*" suffix on an input pattern appends hands-exchanged repeat to pattern
    (This effectively makes the pattern twice as long and symmetric)
The"R" or "L" prefix on a vanilla input throw specifies which hand makes the throw
    (reverts back to alternating hands afterwards)
Examples:

THE SWAP FUNCTION~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Syntax:
swap (term1)(hand1)(throw1) (term2)(hand2)(throw2)

Ex:
swap 4l0 0rl    
# This swaps term 4's 0th LH throw with term 0's 2nd RH throw
# Indices for terms and throws start at 0. 
# first term is swapped to the left, so it wraps around pattern
# to swap with the throw in the 0th term

term1/term2 must be a one or two digit integer in range of the pattern indices
hand1/hand2 must be "r", "R", "l", or "L" 
throw1/throw2 must be a one or two digit integer in range of the indicated site's indices
    Note: if throw index is out of range, then a throw with value '0' will be added and 
    chosen instead. Zeros can only be chosen as the second throw.
Ex:
Given: (6x,4)(-,-)(4,2x)(-,-)(4,6x)(-,-)(2x,4)(-,-)
         <-^                  ^->    
sw 4l0 0r1 -> (6x,[40x])(-,-)(4,2x)(-,-)(4x,6x)(-,-)(2x,4)(-,-)
# The RH 4 throw in term 4 is swapped to the right with a RH 0 throw added to term 0


Purpose:
Swaps throw at throw1 with throw at throw2 (from left to right - wraps around pattern as needed).
This alters the siteswap so that the new throw at throw1 is now rethrown where the original
throw at throw2 was to be rethrown, and the new throw at throw2 is now rethrown where the
original throw at throw1 was to be rethrown.
The first throw value decreases as it is moved from left to right (because it's approaching its
rethrowing site).
The first throw value increases as it is moved from right to left (because it's moving away from
its rethrowing site).
The 'x' status of each throw changes as well so that each throw maintains its rethrowing site.

OTHER NOTES~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parser accepts most valid Juggling Lab siteswap notation (solo only).
Parser assumes implicit null beat after each sync term if no "-" values present.
Parser attempts to fill structure exactly as written.

Validator checks and possibly corrects pattern.
If siteswap invalid, validator tries symmetric form before giving up.
    (This means you can either enter "(6x,4)" or "(6x,4)*")
Odd lengthed vanilla siteswaps are made symmetric before validation.
