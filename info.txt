Parser accepts most valid Juggling Lab siteswap notation (solo only).

Parser attempts to fill structure exactly as written.

Validator checks and possibly corrects pattern.
If siteswap invalid, validator tries symmetric form before giving up.
    (This means you can either enter "(6x,4)" or "(6x,4)*")
Odd lengthed vanilla siteswaps are made symmetric before validation.
